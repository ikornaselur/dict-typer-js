# Dict-Typer JS

A JS port of the Python library [dict-typer](https://github.com/ikornaselur/dict-typer).

Mainly used to play around with TypeScript and Javascript in general and to be
able to create a simple web site to do the conversion. See the original library
for more info for now.

The port only focuses on working with valid json input, while the Python
library aims to support any Python types
